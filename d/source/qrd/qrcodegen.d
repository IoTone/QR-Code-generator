/* 
 * This library creates QR Code symbols, which is a type of two-dimension barcode.
 * Invented by Denso Wave and described in the ISO/IEC 18004 standard.
 * A QR Code structure is an immutable square grid of black and white cells.
 * The library provides functions to create a QR Code from text or binary data.
 * The library covers the QR Code Model 2 specification, supporting all versions (sizes)
 * from 1 to 40, all 4 error correction levels, and 4 character encoding modes.
 * 
 * Ways to create a QR Code object:
 * - High level: Take the payload data and call qrcodegen_encodeText() or qrcodegen_encodeBinary().
 * - Low level: Custom-make the list of segments and call
 *   qrcodegen_encodeSegments() or qrcodegen_encodeSegmentsAdvanced().
 * (Note that all ways require supplying the desired error correction level and various byte buffers.)
